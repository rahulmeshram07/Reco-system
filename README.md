# Reco-system

Need to obtain simulation under following scenarios.

1. Model type-A: The rigid user changes his interest in different topics based on how often topics have been shown. 
For this model we want to do simulations. 

1) Initial user interest is can be skewed or uniform. We want to see the impact of reward on recommendations and the user interest. 
Give the following table to illustrate the numerical results with different reward structure.

session (s),   reco strategy x(s), user interest strategy \theta(s),      F
100   
1000
5000
10000   

skewed reward structure for sites and it is align towards the user interest 
skewed reward structure for sites and it is opposite to user interest
